## The Need for Summer Meals
During the school year, 62% of Oklahoma kids rely on free-and-reduced meals to receive proper nutrition; many of these students do not have access to adequate nutrition outside of school. In Tulsa, a staggering 84% of students rely on free-and-reduced meals. Individual families, as well as [nonprofits](http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/sites-around-tulsa-offer-free-summer-meals-for-children/article_a08c1594-e24c-50b3-b6ef-4f279b6bb891.html "Tulsa World Article about Summer meals programs in Tulsa") could greatly benefit from knowing when and where summer meals programs are available.
